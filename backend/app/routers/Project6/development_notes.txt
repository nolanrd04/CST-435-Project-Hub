1. Started with initial GAN that generated 28x28 images. Generated images were extremely noisy after 50 epochs
and there were no distinguishable features.
2. Upped epoch count to 400. After this, apples, pears, and bananas started to take shape, but were still extremely noisy.
3. Upped resolution to 128x128. Now the apples, pears, and strawberries are entirely identifiable, and somehow are able
to generate shadows to show 3d images. Blackberries, bananas, and grapes are entirely unrecognizeable though.
4. Switch from 3 fully-connected, dense layers to a dynamic number of convolutional layers (6 for 128x128, 5 for 64x64).
Training now has a 0% fool rate and takes about 4x as long.
5. Reverted to 28x28 for faster training, discriminator cant detect fake images at 80 epochs.
Fool rate steadily declines after 80 epochs. Fool rate below 80% at 160 epochs. Fool rate around 60% at 240 epochs.
Fool rate too low around 280 epochs. Can no longer learn.
