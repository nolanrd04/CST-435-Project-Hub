in backend/app/routers/project7, write me a python program that when run, it imports the Tiny ImageNet.
Here are my requirements:
1. Prompts the user in the terminal for data requirements (custom resolution, number of images imported, image categories,        
etc.)
2. The import requirements should have defaults: 64, 10,000 (or storage size cap, for example stop after 50mb of images have      
been imported), all categories, etc.  
3. Saves the images to imageData/ using script-relative directory management. The folder should be created if it doesnt exist.    
4. The actual images should be saved, so i can see them.
